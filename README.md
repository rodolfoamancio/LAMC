# LAMC - Linear alkanes Monte Carlo
This repository centralizes the code implemented for research during my Master's of Science in Chemical Engineering at Unicamp.

## Structure
This code is divided into folders:
1. `src`: source code files, main components for running the program, implementation of Monte Carlo algorithms as well as properties calculations and input/output routines;
2. `scripts`: `python` files used for post-processing data, running multiple simulations on parallel and other routines;
3. `data`: files used for simulating the data presented on the dissertation;
4. `notebooks`: additional `jupyter-notebook` files used for analysing and post-processing the data

## References
The development of this code has been made possible by several research materials mainly, but not restricted, to:
1. Frenkel, Daan, and Berend Smit. Understanding molecular simulation: from algorithms to applications. Vol. 1. Elsevier, 2001.
